# WAYS Phone Data Homogenizer

This system was developed with the purpose of wrangling numerous sources of data into a universal template.


### Upload

Upload either an .xlsx or .csv file. If the file template is not recognized the user will then create a mapping so that the template is recognized in future.

Any time the created maps are recognized in later data, the system will be able to automatically homogenize the data.
